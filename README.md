## Recommended Setup ⚒️

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Node.js
- npm
- Git

## Installation instructions 📑

1. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor.
2. Download and install an **LTS** version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To verify that you have installed it correctly type the command `node -v` in a command line window and it should display the installed version of Node.js

    >Angular applications require an LTS version of Node.js in order to work properly. If you need to have more than one installed Node.js versions in your environment, consider using a node version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

3. **Npm** is already included in Node.js. To verify that you have it, type the command `npm -v` in a command line window and it should display the installed npm version.

    >Windows users: if the previous command is not working, verify that the path of the npm executable has been added to your PATH environment variable.

4. If you do not already have Git installed, navigate to https://git-scm.com/downloads, download the appropriate version for your environment and install it.
